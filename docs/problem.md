In the logs, we're seeing an interesting problem with how the agent interacts with the Calculator tool. Here's what happened:

Tool Mismatch: The agent tried to feed a natural language query "The height of the Burj Khalifa in meters" to the Calculator tool, but the Calculator tool only accepts mathematical expressions like "2 + 2".
Error Handling: When the Calculator tool received this invalid input, it returned an error: "Expression contains invalid characters. Only basic math operations are supported."
Agent Confusion: After receiving this error, the agent got confused and started producing malformed output ("Calculator: Observation: Observation: Thought: Observation:") that doesn't follow the required ReAct format.
Format Enforcement: The framework detected these formatting issues and reported: "Invalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:'"
This is actually a common issue with ReAct agents when they encounter tool errors. The agent is unable to properly recover from the error because:

It tried to use a tool for a purpose it wasn't designed for (Calculator for information retrieval)
The error message confused its understanding of the proper response format
It began mixing up the required action/observation sequence
Despite this error, the test successfully proved that:

The agent can be initialized properly
It can access and use tools
The framework detects and handles formatting errors
For a more robust implementation, you could:

1. Add better error handling in the calculator tool that gives more helpful guidance
2. Enhance the agent prompt with examples of proper tool usage for each specific tool
3. Implement a format fixer that helps the agent recover when it gets confused

This is a good observation of how LLMs can struggle with strict formatting requirements under error conditions, especially with open-source models.
